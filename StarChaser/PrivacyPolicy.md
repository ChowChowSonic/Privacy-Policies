## StarChaser: Privacy policy

Thank you for considering installing my app! 

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data is created by you, the user, stored locally on your device, and can be removed by simply uninstalling the app, and/or deleting it manually. 

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, found in the same folder as this file

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.INTERNET` and `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` | This app only accesses the internet to serve advertisements to the user. |
| `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | These permissions are required to read and write player scores. After every game finishes, the game saves your score to a file in external storage. The game can also read off your highest score and your preformance in the last few games. |
| `android.permission.READ_INTERNAL_STORAGE` | All of the app's files are saved in the read-only internal storage. This is where models and other various visual elements are held. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, bugs in my applications, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email for anything urgent (see below) or post a discussion on GitHub for less important issues/bugs. I will surely try to fix it/help you as soon as I am available.

If you wish to contact me regarding my app, it would help me get back to you faster if you formatted the topic of the email with "[ the name of the app ] - [ problem ]"; For example, "StarChaser - game crashes when X". If you format it like this, you would help me identify the issue much faster, and I'll be able to help you out sooner. 

Yours sincerely,
