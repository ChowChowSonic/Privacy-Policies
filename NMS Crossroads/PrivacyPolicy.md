# NMS Crossroads: Privacy policy

Thank you for considering installing my app! 

As an avid Android user & cybersecurity major myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The app does not keep track of who uploads what, and everyone uploading to the app is 100% anonymous. All data is created BY you, the user, stored on my servers so long as it isn't reported multiple times by other users. 

"wonders" is the umbrella term referring to Planets, starships, multitools & wildlife. 

Any "wonders" that are uploaded to the app will be held onto, being publically visible, so long as the data exists. In the event that a wonder is reported, either for not existing, having inappropriate names/tags, or something else, that wonder will be deleted as soon as I can verify the validity of the report.

Your search history within the app will be saved in the database's logs, so that I can correct any issues or vulnerabilities that may arise with user searches. However, this data is purely for maintenance purposes. It will NOT be accessed for reasons other than maintaining application security, nor will it be sold to third parties. This information is not visible to anyone but myself, and (with the exception of police with a warrant) will NOT be provided to ANYONE, EVER. This data may be periodically deleted, and will not be around forever. (I cannot make any promises as to when this data will be deleted, or for how long it is held onto for.) 

**When any data is deleted, it is gone FOREVER and cannot be recovered or accessed by ANYONE. Not even me.**

## Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, found in the same folder as this file

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.INTERNET` | This app accesses the internet to access our API and retrieve data from our database, alongside serving advertisements. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, bugs in my applications, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email for anything urgent (see below) or post a discussion on GitHub for less important issues/bugs. I will surely try to fix it/help you as soon as I am available.

If you wish to contact me regarding my app, it would help me get back to you faster if you formatted the topic of the email with "[ the name of the app ] - [ problem ]"; For example, "StarChaser - game crashes when X". If you format it like this, you would help me identify the issue much faster, and I'll be able to help you out sooner. 

Yours sincerely,
